# Library of models

A library is a collection of abstract objects: port types and models.

## Structure of a library file
The header of the .yml file must contain exactly one "library" key at the root level.  
The **library** object contains one **id**, one **description**, one **port-types** collection, and one **models**
collection. Unless stated otherwise, all listed fields are mandatory.

## ID & description

Example:

~~~yaml
library:
  id: my_library_id
  description: my library is great!
~~~

- **id**: the unique ID for you library. Beware that if you are using many libraries in your study, every library must
  have a unique ID. This ID will be used inside the [system description file](systems.md) in order to reference the
  library's objects. It must respect [these rules](syntax.md#rules-for-ids).
- **description** _(optional)_: a free description of your library. Has no effect on the simulation.


## Port types

The **port-types** collection lists the possible types of [ports](#models) inside the library,
that can be used by models/components to communicate with each-other.  
This field is optional: 
- you can develop a library with no ports, even though this would have limited interest (the
models would not be able to communicate with each-other),
- you can develop a library that use ports defined in another library.
Example:

~~~yaml
port-types:
  - id: dc_port
    description: A port which transfers power flow value
    fields:
      - id: flow
  - id: ac_port
    description: A port which transfers power flow and voltage angle values
    fields:
      - id: flow
      - id: angle
~~~

- **id**: the ID for the port type. Must be unique inside the scope of the library, and
  respect [these rules](syntax.md#rules-for-ids).
- **description** _(optional)_: a free description of your port type. Has no effect on the simulation.
- **fields**: a collection of coherent fields that transit through this port type. A field holds a single floating
  number.
    - **id**: the ID of the field. Must be unique in the scope of the port type, and
      respect [these rules](syntax.md#rules-for-ids).
- **area-connection** _(optional)_: used only for the [antares-modeler](https://antares-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/modeler/01-overview-modeler/).
  For more information on hybrid
  studies, [see the relevant documentation](https://antares-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/modeler/01-overview-modeler/).

    

## Models

The **models** collection lists all the [models](#models) that can be instantiated using your library. 

~~~yaml
models:
  - id: node
    description: A balance node with injections (productions and loads)
    ports:
      - id: injections
        type: dc_port
    binding-constraints:
      - id: balance
        expression: sum_connections(injections.flow) = 0
~~~

A model is an abstract object, that will be instantiated once or several times in a system. A model is defined by:

- **id**: an ID for the model. Must be unique inside the scope of the library, and
  respect [these rules](syntax.md#rules-for-ids).
- **description** _(optional)_: a free description of the model. Has no effect on the simulation.
- **parameters** _(optional)_: a collection of parameters for the model. The values for these parameters will be set in
  the [system file](systems.md).
    - **id**: an ID for the parameter. Must be unique inside the scope of the model, and
      respect [these rules](syntax.md#rules-for-ids).
    - **time-dependent**: `true` or `false`, indicates whether the parameter depends on time or is constant across the
      whole simulation horizon.
    - **scenario-dependent**: `true` or `false`, indicates whether the parameter changes depending on the simulated
      scenario, or is the same for all scenarios.
- **variables** _(optional)_: a collection of optimisation variables that are defined for this model
    - **id**: an ID for the variable. Must be unique inside the scope of the model, and
      respect [these rules](syntax.md#rules-for-ids).
    - **variable-type**: `continuous`, `integer`, or `binary`
    - **lower-bound** _(optional)_: an [expression](syntax.md) representing the lower bound of the variable. Must use scalars
      and/or parameters only. If missing, defaults to -inf for continuous and integer types, or 0 for binary.
    - **upper-bound** _(optional)_: an [expression](syntax.md) representing the upper bound of the variable. Must use scalars
      and/or parameters only. If missing, defaults to +inf for continuous and integer types, or 1 for binary.
- **constraints** _(optional)_: a collection of "internal" optimisation constraints set by the model
    - **id**: an ID for the constraint. Must be unique inside the scope of the model, and
      respect [these rules](syntax.md#rules-for-ids).
    - **expression**: an [expression](syntax.md) representing the constraint. Can use scalars, parameters, internal
      variables, time and scenario operators.
      Must contain exactly one comparison operator (**=**, **<=**, or **>=**).
- **binding-constraints** _(optional)_: a collection of "external" optimisation constraints set by the model, that use
  ports. While these have no
  real difference with "internal constraints", it is best practice to separate internal and external constraints in
  order to make the model more readable.
    - **id**: an ID for the constraint. Must be unique inside the scope of the model, and
      respect [these rules](syntax.md#rules-for-ids).
    - **expression**: an [expression](syntax.md) representing the constraint. Can use scalars, parameters, internal
      variables, ports, and time, scenario, and port operators.
- **objective** _(optional)_: an [expression](syntax.md) representing the (additive) participation of the model to
  the optimisation objective.
  Note that **minimization** is implied. The expression can use scalars, parameters and variables of the model.
- **ports** _(optional)_: a collection of ports exposed by the model, either as input or output
    - **id**: an ID for the port. Must be unique in the scope of the model, and respect [these rules](syntax.md#rules-for-ids).
    - **type**: the type of the port. Must refer to the ID of a port type defined in the [port types](libraries.md#port-types)
      section.
- **port-field-definitions** _(optional)_: a collection of definitions for ports output by this model. Note that if the
  model is to define a port, then it must define all fields of this port.
    - **port**: the ID of a port exposed by the model (defined in the **ports** section above)
    - **field**: the field to define (refers to a field ID defined in the port type)
    - **definition**: an [expression](syntax.md) representing the definition of the field. Can use scalars,
      parameters, and variables of the model.
